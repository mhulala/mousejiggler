# Mouse Jiggler
This is an AutoHotkey (.ahk) file designed to move move your mouse to prevent screen timeout.

## Dependencies
Requires AutoHotkey to be installed, which can be done at https://www.autohotkey.com/

## Installation
Once AHK is installed, just download the .ahk file and save it somewhere safe (I use my documents folder). Running it for the first time will initiate the boot sequence, after which you can set it to automaitically run on startup by **right-clicking** the track icon it generates. **Left clicking the icon toggles the jiggler.**
